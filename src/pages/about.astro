		Hi, my name is Cameron Brown. I'm a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments. I graduated
		with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in April 2022 and have been working at Fidelity
		as a Software Engineer ever since. In my two years as a professional developer, I have mostly
		worked as a front-end developer developing business applications using Angular and TypeScript.
